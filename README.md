# 🧩 Mini Projects

This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects I'm building while learning web development.

## 📁 What You'll Find Here

Each folder contains a standalone mini project. Example:

- 🎴 **Pokémon Finder** – A frontend + backend app where you can enter a Pokémon type and limit, and get a list of matching Pokémon using Express + Tailwind.

More projects will be added as I keep learning and experimenting 🚀

- Practice what I learn
- Experiment with frontend & backend
